%
% Computes the maximum difference in the diretion of the optical axis for
% the neighbourhood around each pixel. Used in the alignment score outlined
% in: "Novel methodology to image stromal tissue and assess its
% morphological features with polarized light: towards a tumour
% microenvironment prognostic signature," Biomed. Opt. Express 10, 3963-3973 (2019)
%
% --- Input ---
% dirImage: A 2D matrix where each pixel corresponds to the optical axis
% directional at that pixel.
% nhoodSize: The number of pixels to use in the neighbourhood around a
% pixel. For instance, a value of 2 would result in a 5x5 neighbourhood (2
% + 2 + center Pixel = 5).
%
% --- Output ---
% alignmentMatrix: A 2D matrix of the same size as dirImage whose values
% correspond to the maximum angular difference found in the neighbourhood
% of each pixel.
